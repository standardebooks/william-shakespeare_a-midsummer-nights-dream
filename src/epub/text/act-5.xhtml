									<span>More strange than true: I never may believe</span>

									<span>These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.</span>

									<span>Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>More than cool reason ever comprehends.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The lunatic, the lover and the poet</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Are of imagination all compact:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And as imagination bodies forth</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A local habitation and a name.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Such tricks hath strong imagination,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That, if it would but apprehend some joy,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>It comprehends some bringer of that joy;</span>
